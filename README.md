# bashbox

A single script that gives coreutils like things written in pure `bash`.

This isnt intended to be really posix, it is missing lot of things from posix and some things behave differently.

# bxmerge
merge things in bin/ to one executable script or lib

needs git, and bash and coreutils (tested only with gnu and freebsd ones)

options (can be combined):

	bin - make executable binary
	
	fast-bin - same but unformated
	
	lib - make sourceable library

	fast-lib - same but unformated
	
# contributing
if you want contribute, **do not edit "bashbox/bxlib" file, its just automerged file, edit things in /bin or bashbox-bin/-lib/-include.**
