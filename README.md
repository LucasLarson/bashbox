# bashbox

A single script that gives coreutils like things written in pure `bash`.

This isnt intended to be really posix, it is missing lot of things from posix and some things behave differently.

# bashbox-create
(can be called both as ./bashbox bashbox create, ./bashbox-create or , ./bin/bashbox-create)
merge things in bin/ to one script

# contributing
if you want contribute, **do not edit "bashbox" file, its just automerged file, edit things in bin/.**

# thanks
